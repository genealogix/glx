## Key Features Demonstrated

### Evidence Chains at Scale

Every fact traces back to a canonical source through the full evidence chain:

```
Repository → Source → Citation → Assertion → Entity Property
```

For example, Robb Stark's death is documented as:
- **Repository**: "A Song of Ice and Fire (Novels)"
- **Source**: *A Storm of Swords*
- **Citation**: Catelyn VII chapter, with direct text quotes from the Red Wedding
- **Assertion**: `status: proven`, `confidence: high`
- **Person property**: `died_on: "299"`, `cause_of_death: "Murdered at the Red Wedding"`

### Custom Vocabularies

The archive extends standard GLX vocabularies with 200+ domain-specific types:

**Event types** (58 custom): `battle`, `coronation`, `execution`, `tournament`, `trial`, `siege`, `rebellion`, `dragon_hatching`, `guest_right_violation`, `kingsmoot`, `trial_by_combat`, and more.

**Relationship types** (40+ custom): `betrothal`, `ward`, `sworn_sword`, `liege_vassal`, `kingsguard`, `hand_of_the_king`, `master_of_whisperers`, `blood_rider`, `faceless_man`, and more.

**Participant roles** (80+ custom): `commander`, `champion`, `condemned`, `conspirator`, `dragon_rider`, `betrayer`, `presiding_judge`, and more.

**Person properties** (50+ custom): `house`, `alias`, `cause_of_death`, `dragon`, `direwolf`, `valyrian_steel`, `claim_to_throne`, `warging_ability`, and more.

### Temporal Properties

Titles, allegiances, and positions change over time:

```yaml
# From person-eddard-stark.glx
title:
  - value: "Lord of Winterfell"
    date: "FROM 280 TO 299"
  - value: "Warden of the North"
    date: "FROM 280 TO 299"
  - value: "Hand of the King"
    date: "FROM 298 TO 298"
```

### Complex Events with Multiple Participants

Events like the Red Wedding record 15+ participants with distinct roles:

```yaml
# From event-red-wedding.glx
participants:
  - person: person-robb-stark
    role: victim
  - person: person-catelyn-tully
    role: victim
  - person: person-walder-frey
    role: host
  - person: person-roose-bolton
    role: perpetrator
  # ... and more
```

### Hierarchical Place Model

Places form a geographic hierarchy from continents down to individual buildings:

```
Westeros
├── The North
│   ├── Winterfell (castle)
│   ├── Castle Black (castle)
│   └── Bear Island (island)
├── The Crownlands
│   ├── King's Landing (city)
│   │   └── The Red Keep (castle)
│   └── Dragonstone (castle)
└── ...
Essos
├── Braavos (free_city)
├── Astapor (slave_city)
└── ...
```

### Multi-Canon Support

Separate assertions handle novel vs. TV show divergences. For example, Robb Stark's wife:
- **Novel canon**: Jeyne Westerling (confidence: high, source: *A Storm of Swords*)
- **Show canon**: Talisa Maegyr (documented as a separate relationship)

### Confidence and Status Tracking

Assertions reflect the nature of ASOIAF's unreliable narration:

| Confidence | Count | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| High (78%) | 1,406 | Named characters with on-page appearances |
| Medium (20%) | 365 | Characters mentioned but not directly seen |
| Low (2%) | 37 | Legendary figures, disputed identities (e.g., Young Griff's true parentage) |

## File Organization
